public resources. However, name of the Scheme will be kept intact as Pradhan Mantri Awas
Yojana-Urban 2.0 (PMAY-U 2.0).
7.3 To increase affordability of PMAY-U 2.0 houses, apart from Central and State assistance,
funds may also be contributed from other sources for houses sanctioned to specific group
of beneficiaries like Building and other Construction Workers (BoCW) Welfare Funds, District
Mineral Fund etc. The Construction Workers Welfare Fund is set up by States/UTs under
the central law of Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment
and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 which can also suitably be used for construction of
affordable houses by States/UTs.
7.4 Industries through Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) would

Ministry. Central Assistance under BLC, AHP and ARH will be released in 3 instalments of
40%, 40% and 20%.
9.4 States/UTs will further release the Central Assistance to cities and/or other implementing
agencies. In order to provide flexibility, States/UTs will be allowed to release funds on the
basis of actual progress of the projects, implying that for a project being implemented
faster, States/UTs can release more funds for such projects.
9.5 A provision for Fund Transfer Order (FTO) will be made in MIS for tracking the actual status
of fund release to beneficiary under BLC vertical which shall be integrated with the Geotagging stages.
9.6 Funds released to the city or any other implementing agency by State/UT shall be kept in
a separate bank account opened for this Mission for utilization towards implementation of
the Scheme and shall not form part of their general financial operations. SNA-SPARSH or
applicable PFMS mechanism will be followed by States/UTs wherever required.

9.7 Funding under Beneficiary Led Construction:
9.7.1 Under BLC vertical, it would be mandatory for the States/UTs to propose the BLC
houses/projects through a verified list of eligible beneficiaries, approved by SLSMC
with clear land title and 100% entry of Aadhaar seeded beneficiaries in MIS before
sanction of the CSMC.
9.7.2 The 40% central assistance shall be released through SNA-SPARSH or applicable
PFMS mechanism for sanctioned beneficiaries after approval of CSMC. States/UTs
may release the first instalment of financial assistance to approved beneficiaries
from their own share without waiting for the Central Assistance so that the work on
ground may be started. 

9.7.3 The second instalment of 40% for BLC houses shall be released to “Lintel Stage’ geo
tagged beneficiaries from time to time.
9.7.4 The third and final instalment of 20% for BLC houses shall be released based on the
Geo-tagging of Completed stage of the houses.

based on the actual progress made and Geo-tagging of various stages in MIS and
other compliances, without any linkage to progress of the entire project.
For Example, if a BLC project sanctioned by CSMC has 100 beneficiaries, the first
instalment shall be released to all the 100 beneficiaries based on the compliances
as per para 9.7 above. While releasing the 2nd instalment, if only 75 houses have
progressed up to the lintel level as per Geo-tagging status in MIS (eligibility criteria
for releasing the 2nd instalment), the 2nd instalment shall be released for only such
75 beneficiaries subject to other compliances. Similarly, while releasing the 3rd
instalment, if only 50 houses have completed in all respect (eligibility criteria for
releasing the 3rd instalment), then the 3rd instalment shall be released to only such 50
beneficiaries. The release of 2nd and 3rd instalment in this case will not be dependent
on the progress of other houses. The similar process will be followed for remaining
beneficiaries till the completion of houses and release of final instalment within the
project period.
In case of BLC, the beneficiaries are not inter-corelated with each other rather they
are mutually exclusive, and all the beneficiaries are delinked with the project for the
purpose of release of Central Assistance. By following the above process of fund
release, the beneficiaries who are fulfilling the criteria shall not be deprived from
getting the benefits of central assistance due to slow progress of other beneficiaries
of said BLC project.
