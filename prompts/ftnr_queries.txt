  Bank Statement not available/Incomplete


                Bank statement for                                   Bank statement for
                Salaried Customer                                    Self-Employed
            For fresh transactions, the last 6 month's           Last 6 month’s bank statement
             bank statement should reflect the last 6             For BT transactions: 12 months repayment
             months of salary credited.                            track either SOA or bank EMI clearing
            For BT transactions: 12 months repayment              statement.
             track either SOA or bank EMI clearing
             statement.
         Note: For salary credits, if the login occurs
         before the 7th of the month, the last month's
         salary isn't required in the bank statement, but
         6 months of salary credits should be present. If
         the login is after the 7th, the last month's salary
         must be included in the statement.

    Short IMD


               Important points - IMD
         The IMD amount will be strictly based on the application ID creation date in Finverse, either
          by the sourcing staff or channel partners.
         Individual IMD must be collected for all unique application numbers.
         If a top-up LAN is involved, ZSM email approval must be uploaded in the document upload
          tab at the time of file logging to waive the IMD collection, with the approval details clearly
          mentioned.

        Key Points to Avoid Short IMD Queries During the IMD Offer Period: Ensure that login dates during the IMD
        offer period include either the IMD offer email or poster uploaded in the miscellaneous document tab to
        prevent short IMD queries.

  Short IMD


                          The IMD offer runs from September 5th to 10th for 501.
                          However, the login and Finverse application ID were
                          created on September 4th, when ₹5900 was due, but only
                          501 was collected. As a result, the case was moved to CPH
                          with a short IMD, and CPH will raise a query. The
        Sample Scenario
                          remaining amount must be paid in full.


                          In this case, the sourcing staff cannot claim the IMD offer
                          on the 5th or 6th since the application ID was created on
                          September 4th, making the offer inapplicable.

 KYC/Income documents
            Salary Slip
               Salary Slip /Salary Certificate of last 3 months
               Salary Credit banking of last 6 months / If cash salaried then saving
               account to be documented- Account Aggregrator fetch through
               Finverse to be done for relevant Bank
            Co Applicant not added in Finverse
               The co-applicant must be added during the Finverse login stage,
               there is no offline process available for adding a co-applicant.
            Form 60 is not available
               Form 60 is mandatory for the cases where co-applicant doesn’t have
               a PAN card

9
 KYC/Income documents
             Unmasked Aadhar Card
               Aadhaar masking is mandatory as per RBI guidelines. Ensure the
               first 8 digits of the Aadhaar number are masked before uploading
               to Finverse. Uploading an unmasked Aadhaar card will leads to
               case re-login.
             Mother/Father name missing
               Mother's name and father's name must be mentioned in the
               additional details screen in Finverse.
             Others
               Wrong selection on Applicant Type(Ex: Salaried selected as
               SENP/Individual selected as Non-Individual)
               Not attaching Relationship proof
               Old deal ID missing in case of re-login cases.

   Address Mismatch

             Applicant Aadhar address mismatch with current address:
             The Aadhaar card address must match the current address. If not, an Aadhaar address change
             acknowledgment is required during login.

             Co-Applicant Aadhar address mismatch with current address:
             ● If a spouse is a co-applicant and their Aadhar address mismatches with the applicant's, a current
             address declaration must be obtained and signed by both the applicant and co-applicant (spouse).
             ● If the co-applicant is not a spouse, their current address must match their Aadhaar address. If it
             doesn't, an Aadhaar address change acknowledgment is required for all individuals at the time of
             login.

             Address mismatch with EKYC
             After completing Aadhaar validation via OTP through e-KYC, the sourcing staff must ensure that
             the current address matches the actual address.

11
    Address Mismatch


                           Mr. Dhanush is a salaried customer and the applicant. His
                           Aadhaar card lists his address as T Nagar, Chennai, which has
                           been verified through e-KYC by the sourcing staff during file
                           logging in Finverse. However, he has recently transferred jobs
                           and now resides in RS Puram, Coimbatore.
         Sample Scenario   In this case, an Aadhaar address change acknowledgment and
                           a utility bill for the Coimbatore RS Puram location must be
                           submitted before completing the login in Finverse.

                           Additionally, address details must be provided for all
                           references; if not included, the file will be marked as FTNR,
                           and a query will be raised.


12
  Financial/GST Fin Fort ID Creation



              Process to complete the Fin Fort:
               While logging the file in Finverse, the sourcing staff can initiate Fin Fort directly by enabling
               the Digi Income Fetch tab for applicable self-employed profiles. Once completed by the
               customer, the report will be sent directly to Finverse. Only after this should the login process
               continue, and the file be submitted in Finverse.
               Factors to Avoid FTNR Query –
               Fin Fort Number or 2-Year ITR/GST Missing or ITR without Computation:
               The file should be submitted to CPH only after the customer completes the Fin Fort process.

13
  Property Documents Are Not Available


             Required Documents:

              Latest title deed
              Layout and building plan approval or 10-year property tax receipt
               along with revenue document.
             The above-mentioned basic documents must be uploaded in Finverse
             while logging the file.

14
  DSA Lead Sheet
              The DSA lead sheet should be collected by the sourcing staff with
              DSA, ensuring all fields are updated in the sheet and uploaded in
              Finverse.
              If the sourcing journey is done by the DSA directly in Finverse, this
              does not apply.

15
  Business Proof Not Available

              Any government-authorized business proof, such as GST, Udyam
              certificate, and other valid government proof, must be submitted in
              Finverse. Refer to the KYC checklist for detailed information.

16
   Mobile Numbers are Same
              Applicant, co-applicant, and reference mobile numbers must be
              unique; the same mobile numbers should not be updated in Finverse.
