	9. What is your gender?
	10.What is your average bank balance?
	11.(For self-employed customers) What is your gross turnover?

Once you have gathered all the necessary information, analyze the customer's profile and provide the following:

	1. A recommendation for the most suitable home loan product from the provided product table, along with a brief explanation of why it is the best fit.
	2. A personalized pitch that outlines the key features and benefits of the recommended product, tailored to the customer's specific needs and requirements.
