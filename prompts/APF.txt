APF
1. What is APF?
APF stands for Advance Processing Facility. It is a process introduced by ABHFL to approve upcoming builder projects in advance, either with or without a customer proposal. The focus is on the appraisal of the project’s title and technical aspects. Once a project is approved, subsequent customer proposals for properties within the project require less documentation, as the project has already been appraised.
2. What is the purpose of the APF?
The purpose of the APF is to increase efficiency and reduce delays in servicing customers. By approving builder projects in advance, ABHFL ensures that only the title related to a specific property is verified when a customer decides to purchase it, which accelerates the approval process for individual transactions.
3. How does the APF process work?
•	Builder Approval: The builder's project is reviewed and approved by ABHFL in advance, focusing on technical aspects and the project's title.
•	Project Approval: Once a project is approved, it can be used for subsequent customer proposals without needing to repeat the initial appraisals. Only the title of the property is verified when a customer approaches with a proposal.
4. What benefits does APF offer?
•	Reduced Documentation: As the project is already approved, subsequent customer proposals require less documentation.
•	Faster Turnaround Time: With prior approval, the processing time for subsequent cases is shortened.
•	Efficient Use of Resources: Less effort is needed for reviewing the same project multiple times.
•	Special Schemes for Groups: APF allows for customized schemes for groups of customers purchasing within the same approved project.
5. What is the difference between builder approval and project approval under APF?
•	Builder Approval is the initial approval of the builder's project, which includes the technical evaluation and title check.
•	Project Approval occurs after the builder’s project is approved and allows for faster processing of customer proposals related to that project.
6. What happens if a project receives conditional approval under APF?
If a project is given a conditional approval, ABHFL will conduct a detailed scrutiny to ensure that all observations and conditions are met before proceeding with any further approvals.
7. What types of cases are disbursed based on APF?
All fresh purchases and builder transfer under construction cases are disbursed based on the APF, provided the project has been previously approved.
8. Can APF be used for projects without customer proposals?
Yes, APF can be used for projects that are approved even without any specific customer proposal. This proactive approach allows for faster processing when customers later decide to purchase property in the approved project.
9. Is the title of the property verified after project approval?
After the initial project approval, only the title related to the specific property is verified when a customer submits a proposal to purchase a unit within the project.
10. Who recommends projects for APF approval?
Projects are recommended for APF approval by the sales team of ABHFL, ensuring that the proposed builder projects meet the required technical and title criteria.
11. What is the purpose of tracking ABHFL's exposure towards specific builders and projects?
ABHFL tracks its exposure towards specific builders and projects to safeguard its interests. The real estate industry is highly susceptible to economic and regulatory changes. The lifecycle of a project depends on both the builder/developer and the specific project, meaning any negative news or sentiment about either could impact ABHFL's exposure. Therefore, exposure limits are set to minimize risk.
12. How is Project Exposure defined?
Project exposure refers to the total exposure in a project, including all types of transactions, until the project achieves 100% of the construction stage or the occupation certificate/completion certificate is available. This includes transactions such as fresh purchases from the builder, resale, Balance Transfer (BT), and Balance Transfer of Title (BTT).
13. How is project exposure calculated?
Project exposure is calculated based on the total number of units in the project. All types of transactions, including fresh purchases, resale, BT, and BTT, contribute to the total exposure. The exposure is tracked until the project reaches 100% construction completion or receives the necessary certification.
14. What are the exposure limits for builders based on their category?

Answer:
The Builder Scoring Model is a systematic way of evaluating builders based on various criteria such as experience, project size, market feedback, innovation, ongoing projects, and the number of projects completed. The model assigns scores to each parameter, and a weighted score is calculated to categorize the builder into CAT A, CAT B, or CAT C. The final score helps assess the reliability and performance of a builder for business decisions.
62. How is the builder’s score calculated?
Answer:
The builder’s score is calculated based on multiple factors, each contributing to a weighted score. Some of the key parameters include:
•	Years of relevant experience in the industry.
•	Project size (number of units built).
•	Market/customer reviews (feedback on past projects).
•	Innovation in construction/design (use of advanced methodologies or green building techniques).
•	Ongoing projects and unsold stock from previous projects.
•	Number of projects handed over in the past 5 years.
•	Stalled or slow-moving projects.
Each parameter is assigned a score, and a weighted multiplier is applied based on the location and type of projects (e.g., Mumbai & Delhi or CAT A/B/C locations). The final score is used to determine the builder's category.
63. What factors influence the builder's category (CAT A, B, C)?
Answer:
The builder is categorized as CAT A, CAT B, or CAT C based on their total score:
•	CAT A: Builders with scores greater than 7 are considered high performers with minimal risk.
•	CAT B: Builders with scores ranging from 5 to 7 are considered moderate risk.
•	CAT C: Builders with scores less than 5 are high-risk builders.
Factors that influence the score include the builder's experience, the number of ongoing or completed projects, market reviews, and the number of units built.
64. How is the builder's experience evaluated?
Answer:
The builder's experience is assessed based on the number of years in the business. The scoring system assigns the following scores based on years of experience:
•	<3 years: Score = 0
•	3 to 5 years: Score = 7
•	5 to 10 years: Score = 6
•	10 to 17 years: Score = 7
•	17 to 24 years: Score = 8
•	>25 years: Score = 10
65. How are the number of units built by the builder factored into the score?
Answer:
The number of units built by the builder plays a significant role in the scoring. The following scale is used:
•	>500 units: Score = 5
•	301-500 units: Score = 4
•	101-300 units: Score = 3
•	50-100 units: Score = 2
•	<50 units: Score = 1
The location also impacts the weight of the score, with different multipliers applied for Top 9 cities excluding Mumbai & Delhi, CAT A locations, and CAT B & C locations.
66. What is the impact of market/customer reviews on the builder's score?
Answer:
Market/customer reviews significantly influence the builder's score. Reviews related to delayed projects, stalled projects, and overall customer satisfaction are considered:
•	Delayed by 6 months to 1 year: Score = 0
•	Delayed by 1-2 years: Score = 0
•	Delayed by more than 2 years: Score = 0
•	Stalled projects: Score = 0
•	Positive reviews (Excellent feedback): Positive scores added.
Builders with positive market reviews will see an increase in their score.
67. How is innovation in construction/design assessed?
Answer:
Innovation is assessed based on the use of advanced construction methodologies or green building techniques. The scoring categories include:
•	Conventional construction: Score = 0
•	Green building using conventional methods: Score = 5
•	Advanced construction methodology: Score = 7
•	Green building using advanced methods: Score = 10
Innovative and sustainable practices help increase the builder’s score.
68. How does the number of ongoing projects affect the builder’s score?
Answer:
The number of ongoing projects directly impacts the builder's score. Builders with a larger number of ongoing projects are evaluated based on the scale of their operations:
•	For Mumbai & Delhi: More ongoing projects lead to a higher score.
•	CAT A & B & C locations: Different scoring is applied depending on the number of ongoing projects, with higher numbers yielding better scores.
The score is also adjusted based on whether the builder has unsold stock in previous projects.
69. How does the builder's track record on project delivery affect their score?
Answer:
The builder's track record on past project handovers is assessed based on the number of projects successfully handed over in the last 5 years:
•	>5 years: Score = 10
•	3-5 years: Score = 7
•	1-3 years: Score = 5
•	<1 year: Score = 0
The builder is rewarded with a higher score for a strong record of on-time project delivery.
70. How is the issue of stalled or slow-moving projects factored in?
Answer:
Stalled or slow-moving projects can negatively impact the builder’s score. Builders with a high number of stalled or slow-moving projects may receive a negative score multiplier. For example:
•	Builders with more than 30% stalled projects may face a score reduction of -1.5.
•	Builders with <10% stalled projects will generally not face a score penalty.
71. How does the builder’s administrative office setup impact the score?
Answer:
The builder’s administrative office setup is another factor considered for scoring. Builders with a permanent administrative office setup for the past 5 years score higher. For instance:
•	Permanent setup for 5+ years: Score = 10
•	Setup for less than 5 years: Lower scores are assigned.
This reflects the stability and professionalism of the builder’s operations.

72. How does the location of a project influence the builder's score?
Answer:
The location of the project plays a significant role in the scoring process. Builders working in Top 9 cities, Mumbai & Delhi, or CAT A locations tend to get higher scores compared to builders working in CAT B & C locations. The score is weighted based on the location's market potential and the builder’s experience in those regions.
