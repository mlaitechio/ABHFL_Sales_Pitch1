Q. Hi Genie, I know from our previous discussion that  commercial saleable area would be the deciding factor for Integrated Housing projects.

Answer - Irrespective of whether we have obtained valuation of 100% of the project or only the residential part of the project, in any integrated housing project where the commercial space exceeds 10% of the total FSI of the project, the loan will have to be considered as non-housing. 
Q. Okay, so I will have to consider the Commercial saleable area of the entire project and not only the residential portion for the purposes of deciding housing or non-housing.
