  "summarization": "The revised PAN Verification Process SOP outlines changes to the PAN verification procedure, emphasizing the need for additional details beyond just the PAN number for successful verification. The process now requires specific information depending on the type of entity:\n\n1. **Individual**: Requires PAN number, first name, middle name (optional), last name, and date of birth as per PAN.\n2. **Non-Individual**: Requires PAN number, name of the entity/firm, and date of incorporation.\n3. **Proprietorship**: Requires PAN number, name as per PAN, and date of birth.\n\nThe SOP highlights that if all PAN-related fields are not verified, a green tick will appear against the ones that are verified. It provides examples where the PAN number and date of incorporation are verified, but the company name is not.\n\nThe document details changes in PAN integration across various modules:\n\n1. **Sourcing**: Sales managers/executives must enter PAN details accurately to validate and save them.\n2. **File Login**: Details from the sourcing stage flow into this stage, allowing revisions. The \"Add Applicant\" option is available to add co-applicants, and once PAN fields are validated, they become non-editable.\n3. **Demographic Data Entry**: Similar to the file login stage, with the addition of a \"Trigger PAN\" option for incorrect PAN details.\n4. **Underwriting/Recredit Stage**: Details flow from previous stages, with options to add co-applicants and validate PAN details.\n5. **APF Stage**: PAN validation is integrated into this module for adding new entities and projects.\n6. **Seller Verification**: PAN validation runs if PAN is selected as the mode of identification, although this section is non-mandatory.\n7. **Agency Creation**: PAN validation is now part of this module.\n\nCommon reasons for PAN not getting validated include discrepancies between the name format on the PAN card and the IT database, such as surname-first format or single-letter first names.\n\nThe SOP includes visual aids to guide users through the process and emphasizes tabbing out after entering details to trigger validation."
