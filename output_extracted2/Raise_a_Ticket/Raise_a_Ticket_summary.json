  "summarization": "The Finverse system has introduced a new functionality that allows users to raise a ticket directly from the header of any screen without needing to switch tabs. This feature is designed to streamline the process for users who encounter errors or issues. To raise a ticket, users should click on the Question mark icon, which presents two dropdown options, and select \"Raise a Ticket.\"\n\nUpon selecting \"Raise a Ticket,\" users are redirected to a new tab where they need to specify \"Finverse Application\" as the project. This action will auto-populate certain fields from the JIRA application. The fields to be completed include:\n\n1. **Raise the request on behalf of:** The name of the user raising the JIRA ticket will be automatically populated.\n2. **Finverse Application Category:** Users must specify the epic of the LPP (Loan Processing Platform) journey where the issue is occurring. An epic refers to the stages of the LPP journey.\n3. **Summary:** Users should provide a brief description of the issue.\n4. **Description:** A detailed explanation of the issue, including application details, is required.\n5. **Attachment:** Users should attach screenshots of the error for reference.\n6. **Send:** After completing all required fields, users can send the JIRA ticket for resolution.\n\nOnce the ticket is submitted, the Production Support team will address and resolve the issue. If users have any queries or face issues, they can contact specific points of contact (SPOCs) according to the escalation matrix provided:\n\n- **First Level:** Nilesh Kadam, Shruti Jadhav, Vishal Singh (Email: ABHFL.LOSsupport@adityabirlacapital.com) with a turnaround time (TAT) of 0-4 hours.\n- **Second Level:** Ashutosh Tiwari (Email: ashutosh.tiwari@adityabirlacapital.com) with a TAT of 4-12 hours.\n- **Third Level:** Sangeeta Mansabdar (Email: sangeeta.mansabdar@adityabirlacapital.com) with a TAT of the second day.\n- **Final Escalation:** Shellender Kumar (Email: shellender.kumar@adityabirlacapital.com) with a TAT of the third day.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently, with clear escalation paths for unresolved matters."
