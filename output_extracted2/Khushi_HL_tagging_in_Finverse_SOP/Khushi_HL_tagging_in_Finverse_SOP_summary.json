  "summarization": "The document titled \"Processing Khushi HL in Finverse – SOP\" outlines the procedures for handling the Khushi HL sub-variant within the Finverse system, in alignment with the ABHFL product offerings. The Khushi HL sub-variant is available for specific combinations, specifically for Non-BT (Balance Transfer) and RI (Refinance) selections. It is applicable to two segments: Home Loan Purchase and Home Construction Loan, both under the informal category.\n\nKey steps and details in the process include:\n\n1. **Sourcing Stage**: Sales executives or Relationship Managers (RMs) are responsible for capturing and submitting application details. These details flow through subsequent stages such as File Login, DDE (Due Diligence Examination), and Underwriting. Revisions to the sub-variant can be made as needed.\n\n2. **Benchmark Type and Rate**: The benchmark type for Khushi HL is ARR17, which is visible at the DDE stage and subsequent stages. The current benchmark rate for ARR17 is 5.5%.\n\n3. **Underwriting Stage**: The CPH team conducts checks and forwards the application to Underwriting, where criteria fulfillment for Khushi HL is verified. If norms are not met, a 'No Go' NFA (No Further Action) is triggered.\n\n4. **Parameters and Values**:\n   - **Loan Amount**: Maximum of 20 lakhs, including both primary and secondary products.\n   - **Property Area**: Maximum of 60 sqm (645.83 sqft).\n   - **Annual Household Income**: Maximum of 6 lakhs, applicable to the applicant and co-applicants whose income is tagged as 'Yes'.\n\n5. **Interest Rate**: The maximum Rate of Interest (ROI) for Khushi HL is ARR17 + 7%. If a higher proposed rate is mentioned during Pricing Approval, a hard stop is displayed. With ARR17 configured at 5.5%, the maximum ROI is 12.5%.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Khushi HL tagging appears in various documents such as the Application Form, Sanction Letter, and Key Facts Statement (KFS). Samples are provided in the document.\n\n7. **Checklist**: The NDC DI checklist includes specific points against which fulfillment is checked.\n\nOverall, the SOP provides a structured approach to processing Khushi HL applications, ensuring compliance with product norms and facilitating smooth transitions through different stages of loan processing."
