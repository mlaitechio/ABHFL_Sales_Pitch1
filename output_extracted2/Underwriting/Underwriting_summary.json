  "summarization": "The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Underwriting Modules provide detailed guidance on various processes involved in loan underwriting using systems like Finverse and A3S. The document is structured into several sections, each addressing specific aspects of the underwriting process.\n\n1. **System Booking Logic**: This section outlines the products and eligibility programs that need to be booked in Finverse and A3S. It includes a detailed table listing different loan products, their respective loan amounts, system product codes, and applicable schemes.\n\n2. **Customer Dedupe-Posidex**: Posidex is used to assign unique Customer IDs to applicants and eliminate duplication. The process involves verification checks to determine if an applicant is a new or existing customer, followed by assigning new or old customer IDs accordingly.\n\n3. **Property Dedupe-Posidex**: Similar to customer deduplication, Posidex is used to assign unique Property IDs to collaterals. The process involves checking for matches and assigning new or old property IDs based on whether the collateral is new or existing.\n\n4. **Finfort Initiation-ITR & GST**: This section describes the steps for initiating Finfort to fetch Income Tax Returns (ITR) and Goods and Services Tax (GST) details at different stages, including sourcing and underwriting. It includes tracking the status of orders and ensuring successful completion of tasks by customers.\n\n5. **Waiver of Technical Initiation**: The document outlines scenarios where technical evaluation can be waived, such as in balance transfer (BT) and top-up cases. It provides steps for waiving technical evaluations and ensuring accurate loan-to-value (LTV) decisions.\n\n6. **Waiver of Field Investigation (FI)**: This section describes the process for waiving field investigations when the applicant's current address matches the E-KYC address. It includes steps for selecting waiver options and capturing remarks.\n\n7. **Query Module**: The query module allows users to raise queries at any stage of the loan application process. It includes features for raising queries internally, to agencies, or to customers, and outlines the process for responding to queries and tracking their status.\n\n8. **LEI Tagging**: Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) tagging is required for non-individual entities with aggregate exposure over 5 crores. The document provides steps for tagging LEI, including triggering integration and checking responses.\n\n9. **CRE Tagging**: Commercial Real Estate (CRE) tagging involves identifying properties as CRE based on dwelling units owned. The process varies depending on whether technical evaluation is completed, and includes steps for manual and automatic tagging.\n\n10. **Document Folder in Finverse**: This section explains how to view and categorize documents within Finverse. It includes steps for searching applications, viewing documents by category, and downloading entire document sets.\n\n11. **Scorecard**: The scorecard section describes the process for auto-fetching Bureau and Retail Persona scores on Finverse. It includes steps for viewing scores, re-triggering scores, and handling discrepancies between scores generated on Ezflo and Finverse.\n\nOverall, the SOP provides comprehensive instructions for managing various aspects of the underwriting process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in loan application handling."
