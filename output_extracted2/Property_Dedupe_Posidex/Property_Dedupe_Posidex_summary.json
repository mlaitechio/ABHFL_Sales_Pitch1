  "summarization": "The guidance outlines the process for using Posidex's Property Dedupe system, which helps identify duplicate property entries in a database. The system can result in either a \"Match Found\" or \"No Match Found\" scenario based on the input data.\n\n**Match Found Case:**\n\n1. **Existing Address in Posidex Database:** The system checks the database for existing property addresses.\n   \n2. **Underwriting Stage:** Users enter property details in the Property Details Screen, ensuring they match the existing data in the Posidex database.\n\n3. **Enter Contact Person Details:** After entering the property details, users input contact person information and click \"Proceed.\"\n\n4. **Dedupe Results Display:** Upon proceeding, the system displays dedupe results indicating a \"Match Found\" along with application details for the same property address.\n\n5. **Assign UPID:** Users click on \"Assign UPID,\" and the system confirms the assignment with a \"Successfully Assigned\" message.\n\n**No Match Found Case:**\n\n1. **Existing Address in Posidex Database:** Similar to the match found case, the system checks for existing addresses.\n\n2. **Different Floor/Unit Number:** If the floor number or unit number entered differs from the existing address in the database, the system displays a \"No Match Found\" result. Any discrepancy in the entered fields compared to the existing property address will result in a \"No Match Found.\"\n\n3. **Dedupe Results Display:** The system confirms the dedupe result as \"No Match Found.\"\n\n4. **Assign UPID:** Despite the \"No Match Found\" result, users can still click on \"Assign UPID,\" and the system will display a \"Successfully Assigned\" message.\n\nThis guidance ensures that users can accurately identify duplicate property entries and manage them effectively within the Posidex system, whether a match is found or not."
