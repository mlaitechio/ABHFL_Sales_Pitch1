  "summarization": "The document titled \"Payment Lounge Integration in Finverse - SOP\" outlines the process and procedures for integrating Payment Lounge with Finverse to manage customer payments for processing fees. The integration allows payments to be routed through Payment Lounge, enhancing the payment process within Finverse.\n\n1. **Integration Overview**: Payment Lounge has been integrated with Finverse to facilitate customer payments for processing fees. The sales team will continue their existing process at the sourcing stage, which involves reviewing eligibility and triggering a payment link to the customer.\n\n2. **Payment Process**: Once the payment link is triggered, it directs the customer to the Customer Portal (TML), where they can make payments using various modes. The available payment methods include:\n   - Scan QR\n   - UPI-based payments\n   - Net Banking\n   - Card-based payments\n\n3. **Transaction Handling**: \n   - If a transaction fails, the payment status will reflect the failure, and the customer can attempt the payment again.\n   - Upon successful payment, the application progresses to the next screen, and an application number (starting with series 3000) is generated.\n   - After payment completion, a 'Payment Acknowledgement' is generated and stored in the Finverse Documents section and the Document Management System (DMS).\n\n4. **Subsequent Payments**: Additional payment links for charges such as E-Agreement fees can be triggered from the Customer Worklist under the Fees & Charges section.\n\n5. **Reconciliation and Documentation**: Payment details are available for reconciliation in the Fees and Charges section under Payments, Payment Documents, Cheques, and Related documents. A Payment Lounge report is also available for reconciliation purposes.\n\nOverall, the integration aims to streamline the payment process, provide multiple payment options, and ensure proper documentation and reconciliation of transactions within Finverse."
