  "summarization": "The document outlines the process of deduplication used by Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited to identify repeat customers by matching new customer data with existing records. The deduplication process involves comparing various data points such as names, KYC data, contact information, addresses, and more. The matching logic goes beyond simple string matching and incorporates fuzzy string matching algorithms to identify entities that are similar but not identical. Multiple algorithms are used, each with assigned confidence levels, to achieve a robust matching system.\n\nKey parameters involved in the deduplication process include:\n- Voter ID\n- Driving License\n- Passport Number\n- PAN (Permanent Account Number)\n- Email ID\n- First Name\n- Last Name\n- Date of Birth (DOB)\n- Phone Number\n- Father/Spouse Name\n\nCertain parameters like PAN, Voter ID, Passport Number, Driving License, DOB, and Mobile Number are given a 100% match weightage, while names and addresses are given an 80% match weightage. For NRI customers, a passport is mandatory with a 100% match requirement.\n\nThe deduplication process is integrated into both mobile sales applications and web applications at the pre-deal and deal capture stages. If three or more parameters match out of the five key parameters, the system reflects a match with a score of 250%. Additionally, a Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC) is generated based on this logic.\n\nThe document also details seven rules for identifying matches:\n1. Name + DOB + Address + City\n2. Name + DOB + Address + Pincode\n3. Name + Mobile\n4. PAN\n5. Passport\n6. Voter ID\n7. Driving License\n\nNegative scenarios are outlined for each rule, indicating no match found if certain changes are made to the data points involved in the rule.\n\nFurthermore, 22 combinations are provided for categorizing matches in the Posidex integration response, with scores ranging from 260 to 300, categorized as \"Good\" or \"Average.\" The abbreviations used in these combinations include:\n- P: PAN\n- M: Mobile\n- U: Unique Pin Code\n- V: Voter ID/Passport Number/Driving License\n- D: DOB\n- N: Name\n- A: Address\n\nThe document emphasizes the importance of assigning a Customer Code Identification (CCID) if a match is found, which is mandatory for proceeding with the application from the CAM Underwriting Stage for both applicants and co-applicants.\n\nOverall, the deduplication process aims to enhance cost savings, efficiencies, and fraud prevention while reducing compliance and regulatory risks. The logic and framework are subject to discussion and potential modification with the Posidex team to ensure robustness."
