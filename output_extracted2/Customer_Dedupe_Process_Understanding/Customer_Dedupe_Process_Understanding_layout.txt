Process Understanding – Dedupe
Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited
Identifying similar records in a system
Process Understanding Dedupe
To find whether a new customer who has just joined the platform, is a repeat customer or not, we
match their data with the data of all the existing customers in the system — Like the name of the
new customer to the names of all the existing customers. Apart from just the name we also
consider matching their KYC data, contact, address, and some more information.
•
The logic here cannot be limited to just a simple string match with case insensitivity.
•
It should also do fuzzy string matches where entities that are not exactly equal but are very
much like each other are also considered the same.
•
We have built a fuzzy match along with % assigned to get those results whose match score is
above a certain threshold (Attached excel & Scoring). We also realized that one fuzzy algorithm
does not give us the best match. So, we used multiple algorithms with a weighted mean based
on some confidence that we gave to every algorithm along with control test for such logic.

Recommendation with Logic along with Weightages
Data deduplication is more than a space saving feature. It yields cost savings and efficiencies, in the long run, not to mention thwarting fraud risks significantly.  It also cuts down
compliance and regulatory risks. Though, the lack of standards for implementation and technology varies, making it tough so we have arrived with below scenarios and combination
for evaluating logic for Dedupe and UCIC checks.

Customer de-dupe functionality is present on Mobile Sales application and Web application (Pre-deal and Deal Capture stage) while capturing customer details.Below are the
Parameters fields should be involved in de-dupe functionality.
o
Voter ID
o
Driving License
o
Passport Number
o
PAN
o
Email ID
o
First Name
o
Last Name
o
DOB
o
Phone Number
o
Father/ Spouse Name
o
PAN: - 100%
o
Voter ID/ Passport Number/Driving License: - 100%
o
DOB: - 100%
o
Name: - (First + Last Name) 80%

As the customer onboards the application through any platform customer first check to done is “First name and Last Name”

Basis to those further checks to be conducted.
o
Mobile No: - 100%
o
Address :- 80%

NRI customer: Passport Mandatory- 100%

If any 3 or more than 3 parameters are matched out of 5 parameters above match, then the front-end screen should reflect a match. Score should be 250%.

Similarly, UCIC (customer ID) too should be generated on the above logic at the back end.
The above logic is been send and discussion would be done with Posidex team for any further changes in logic so that we can build a robust Dedupe & UCIC framework going forward.
