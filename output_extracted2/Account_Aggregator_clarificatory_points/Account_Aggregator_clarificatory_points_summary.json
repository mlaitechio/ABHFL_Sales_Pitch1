  "summarization": "The document provides clarifications on handling various scenarios related to the Account Aggregator process within the Finverse system. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Fetching**: If data fetched from the Account Aggregator is incomplete, it is based on the date range selected in Finverse. To retrieve additional banking data, the Account Aggregator task must be retriggered from Finverse after entering the necessary bank details. The customer can then initiate and complete the remaining steps as outlined in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\n2. **Excel Output Generation Issues**: The excel output for banking analysis is available only when the mode is set to 'Finbox Integration (Upload)' or 'Finbox Integration (Send Link to Customer)'. If the excel output is not generated despite these settings, a Jira ticket should be raised to the support team for assistance.\n\n3. **Bank Details Fetching Issues**: When entering a mobile number in the Track My Loan portal, it must match the number linked to the respective bank account for the details to be fetched. If the mobile number does not match, the bank details will not be retrieved.\n\n4. **Checking Account Aggregator Task Status**: After initiating the Account Aggregator task in Finverse, its status will initially appear as 'In Progress'. Once completed, the status will change to 'Completed', and the excel report output from the task will be visible on the user interface.\n\n5. **Handling Technical Errors**: If technical errors occur after selecting an Account Aggregator vendor, users can switch to a different partner and attempt to complete the process again. If issues persist despite these efforts, a Jira ticket should be raised to the support team for resolution.\n\nThese clarifications aim to streamline the process of using the Account Aggregator within Finverse and provide solutions for common issues encountered during its operation."
